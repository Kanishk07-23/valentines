          <p><strong>My Dearest Marshmallow,</strong></p>
          <br>
          <p>
            I wanna start by saying, I am so grateful and lucky to have you in my life.
            I am so sorry I made you feel so distant and I'm so sorry I made you feel unloved.
            I promise you I will try my hardest and make you feel loved, valued and precious again.
            Just how I see you in my eyes.
            I want to see the sparkle in your eyes again, 
            The same sparkle you had when you saw me first time after i confessed.
            I want to kiss you on your forehead, give you flowers and caress your hair,
            Your head resting in my lap, us looking into each others eyes,
            Staring into each other's soul.
            I know its been hard but I will make sure its only uphill from now.
            I love you, and i want to keep loving you till the last of my breath.
            You are my heart, the other half of my soul.
            Marrying and living a happy life together with you is now like a life goal.
            Every time this relationship is tested i promise i will prove myself that i'm a better man.
            An improved man that learns from his mistakes and strives to be a better bf for his girl.
            Nikshita Chavan you're my precious little girl and no matter what happens nothing could change that.
            I will fight any stones or thorns that are in our paths and make sure you are always happy,
            Even if i have to carry you in my arms and walk over those said thorns.
            I want to put the past few months behind us like a bad memory and start anew,
            More understanding, more mature and a much stronger couple. 
            So Nikshita Chavan, do you wanna grow old with me? 
            Travel countries with me? Grow a family with me? Laugh at my bad jokes again?
            Will you be my valentine this year and the years to come ?
          </p>
