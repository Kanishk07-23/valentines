          <p><strong>My Dearest Marshmallow,</strong></p>
          
          <p style="white-space: pre-line">
            I want to start by saying I am profoundly grateful and incredibly lucky to have you in my life.
            I am deeply sorry for the distance I created, and I regret ever making you feel unloved.
            I promise to strive my hardest to make you feel cherished, valued, and precious again—
            Just as I behold you in my eyes.
            
            I yearn to see that sparkle in your gaze again, 
            The same radiance you held when you first saw me after I confessed.
            I want to kiss your forehead, offer you flowers, and caress your hair,
            While your head rests in my lap, us gazing into each other’s eyes,
            Staring deep into each other's souls.
            
            I know it has been arduous, but I will ensure our journey is only upward from here.
            I love you, and I desire to keep loving you until my very last breath.
            You are my heart, the other half of my soul.
            Marrying you and living a blissful life together is my ultimate goal.
            
            Every time this relationship is tested, I promise to prove that I am a better man—
            An improved man who learns from his mistakes and strives to be the partner you deserve.
            Nikshita Chavan, you are my precious girl, and no matter what transpires, nothing could ever alter that.
            
            I will battle any stones or thorns in our path to ensure your happiness,
            Even if I must carry you in my arms and walk over those very thorns myself.
            I want to leave the past few months behind us like a fading memory and start anew,
            More understanding, more mature, and as a much stronger couple. 
            
            So, Nikshita Chavan, do you want to grow old with me? 
            Traverse the world with me? Build a family with me? Laugh at my terrible jokes again?
            Will you be my Valentine this year and for all the years to come?
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
